        <h3>Katsudon: comfort food and delicious meal, a favorite of not only Japanese but by people around the world.</h3>
        <h4><p>The origin of this hearty and wonderful dish goes a long way from Tokyo at around 1899.

            <ol>
                <li>Making the pork cutlet:</li>
                    <li>Have a frying pan or cast iron ready: Add a thin layer of oil to the skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper, and dust with a light, even coating of flour.</li>
                    <li>In one shallow bowl, beat one egg and dip the pork evenly covering it with egg.</li>
                    <li>Coat the pork with panko.</li>
                    <li>Place the coated pork chop on the hot oil for 4-5 minutes on each side or until the panko is golden brown</li>
                    <li>Remove the pork cutlet from the skillet.</li>
                    <li>Cut the pork at around three quarters of an inch each and let it sit on a paper towel to drain excess oil.</p></li>
                <li><p>Break the eggs into a bowl and mix until the yolks are broken, but there are still separate areas of white and yolk.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the dashi, sugar, soy sauce sake and potato starch to a bowl and stir to combine.</p></li>
                <li><p>Add the oil and onions to a non-stick frying pan over medium high heat and saute the onions until soft and just starting to brown.</p></li>
                <li><p>Push the onions to the edge of the pan and add the tonkatsu in the center.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pour the sauce around the cutlet and cover for 1 minute to let the sauce thicken and the katsu reheat.</p></li>
                <li><p>Pour the egg all over and around the katsu and sprinkle.</p></li>
                <li><p>Let it sit for a few minutes but do not let the egg get cooked too much.</p></li>
                <li><p>Put the hot rice into bowls and cover with the tonkatsu and egg mixture, drizzling any remaining sauce on top.</p></li>
